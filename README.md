Competitive Programming Enjoyer

If you've reached this, hello! I am Jonathan. I currently study inverse problems, MCMC methods,
diffusion/flow models for applied mathematics problems, and geometry.

I'm also an avid competitive programming enjoyer. I'm currently trying to increase my Codeforces rating!
Follow my journey here: [https://codeforces.com/profile/jma02](https://codeforces.com/profile/jma02).

Some gists I find useful.
